This the study notes of linear regression/multi linear regression
 
For a single variable, the linear regression can be written as y=Mx+ C. We usually use least squared method to get the value of M and C. This page has the math details of calculating the value:https://brownmath.com/stat/leastsq.htm#FindNocalc.

Assumptions for Linear Regression:
Linear relationship
Multivariate normality
No or little multicollinearity
No auto-correlation
Homoscedasticity
